    <h2>Why Groceries?</h2>

    <p>Grocery shopping can be a long and cumberson process. Often times one store will not have what you need
      which requires you to travel to multiple inorder to aquire all of the groceries that you need. When brainstorming
      ideas for this project we all identified the challenge of
      acquiring all of the ingredients we needed to prepare meals a real struggle.
      As busy college students we wanted a way to quickly determine the best plan to
      complete all of our grocery shopping and from that idea GroceryHelper was born.

    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>We are all first year students at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. Though most of us are planning to major
      in different types of engineering, in our second semester at Olin we all opted to take the class Software Design. For our final project,
    bound together through the love of food and dislike for performing menial tasks, we have became team GroceryHelper.</p>
    <form action="/about_us" method="post">
    <h2>Maggie</h2>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='cow_maggie.jpg') }}" class="image-right" id = "maggie" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
    <p>Maggie really likes cows and dislikes merge conflicts. She is a native of Washington state and has a strong affinity for her home city
    of Tacoma, WA. At Olin she is unsure what she will major in but is planning to major in either mechanical or environmental engineering
    because she finds sustainability fascinating. If you are looking for her you can probably find her inhaling solder fumes in the LPB, sleeping
    in the QEA room, falling down playing frisbee, or somewhere in the mountains.</p>
    <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
    <p>I went into this project with the goal of just gaining more experience programming in python. Additionally, I wanted to gain more
      experience using data from an API, because I had never done a project that had used one before, and learn how to develop a web app.
    <h2>Kyle</h2>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='cow_kyle.jpg') }}" class="image-right" id = "kyle" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
    <p>Kyle is very passionate about the environment, which makes it really hard to live with himself, given he is a methane-producing cow.
        He is a native West Coaster but was shipped west to the Big Island of Hawaii to fatten up before coming to MA. At Olin,
        he spends his time swearing at broken databases, refactoring disorganized code, and writing bio web pages at 2 in the morning. If you are looking for Kyle,
        you can probably find him in the QEA room, in the dining hall, in the QEA room (no, that's not a typo), or watching Man in the High Castle with friends
        on his n+1 beanbag.</p>
    <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
        <p>Kyle's personal goal was to learn to use the Python web development framework Django, which he did. Upon discovering the difficulties
        of integrating everyone else's code with Django, that idea was scrapped, and instead Flask was used as the web framework. But all of
            the work was not for naught, as he plans on developing using Django over the summer with the Olin library.</p>
    <h2>Elena</h2>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='cow_elena.jpg') }}" class="image-right" id = "elena" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
    <p>Elena really likes to find new recipes and hates when her tea is to hot to drink. She is also a native of Washington state and would
    like to take this time to mention that Tacoma, her home city, is the second largest city in western Washington. At Olin she is
    maybe probably going to major in mechanical engineering but she has recently realized that she also likes to code. If you cannot find her
    she is probably in her room working there because she likes to keep it hella warm, in the QEA room, laser cutting something for Baja, playing with
    disks made of dinosaurs, or in Washington.</p>
    <h3>Personal Goal</h3>
    <p>My personal goal for this project was to learn more about different types of APIs. I also wanted to learn
      more about using multiple APIs together and how to integrate the data. Additionally, I was curious about different types of algorithms
      and how they can be used to sort and make use of large datasets.</p>
    <h2>Nina</h2>   <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='cow_nina.jpg') }}" class="image-right" id = "nina" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
    <p>Nina really likes aesthetics and dislikes GitHub issues. She is the only native Massachusetts resident on the team and would like to
      point out that she is a good driver. At Olin she is also planning to major in engineering with computing because she likes to do
      that and Girls who Code did a good job of teaching her that she can. If you are looking for her she is probably making a fool of herself
      with OPIUM (not a drug), in the QEA room, sitting on her bed because it is comfortable, or chasing plastic disks outside.

    <h3>Personal Goal</h3>
    <p>My personal goals were to gain experience with using APIs as well as how to integrate python with web development. I also really
    liked discussing the algorithm needed for our program.</p>

    <h2> Main Idea</h2>
    <p>GroceryHelper is a tool to make grocery shopping quicker and easier. When ingredients
      and an origin location are inputted, our GroceryHelper webapp will output a shopping plan
      which includes: a list of stores to visit in sequential order, a map with directions to each
      store and back to your origin, and a list of which ingredients to buy at each store. The
      outputted path is the minimum distance the user has to travel in order to get all the ingredients
      they need. The goal of GroceryHelper is to minimize time spent shopping and the disappointment of
      caused by not finding the items that the shopper wants at the grocery store. Additionally, if the
      shopper does not know what they want to eat they can input a cuisine and some ingredients and
      GroceryHelper will output a recipe and a path plan to purchase the extra ingredients needed.</p>


    <h2>Implementation information</h2>

    <p><img class="image-right" src="/static/Flowchart.png" alt="Program flowchart"/>
      The GroceryHelper path finding algorithm works by first filtering grocery stores by Euclidean
      distance away from the location of the user. This is done by using the latitude and longitude
      of the locations. It then identifies which stores have which ingredients and makes a list of
      every path possible to get all the ingredients. Each calculated path is then scored based on
      how many stops there are and what the total distance traveled is. The path with the minimum
      score is chosen and then the route the user should take along with the items they should buy
      at each store is given to the user.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p>
      You can explore the results of our project under the Get Started tab to try it out! We were able to accomplish a
      lot of our stretch goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Project evolution</h2>

    <p>Our initial goal for this project was to create a WebApp that could tell you the cheapest and fastest places
      to buy your groceries. Unfortunately, came up with the idea before we actually found an API, and, unfortunately,
      the majority of the information that we needed to be successful was very proprietary, and therefore could not be
      found for free on the interwebs. So instead of focusing on prices, we pivoted a little and decided to focus the app
      on finding the fastest route to get all of your groceries. An added feature was that we roped in a recipe database
      and added a meal planning helper. Thus, GroceryHelper was born.
      <br>
      <br>
      Along the development path, we hit more road bumps. We started the project using Django for our database and planned
      to use it for web development as well. However, it turns out that Django is really confusing and complete overkill for
      the website applications we needed, so a few weeks in, we switched everything over to Flask. We had used Flask during
      other class assignments and felt comfortable with it, so things went much more smoothly from there. We love Flask!
      <br>
      <br>
      Another problem arose when we started testing our path planning algorithm. After looking more closely at the data that
      we were getting back from the Supermarket API, we realized that many areas of the country were very poorly represented,
      and some not at all. We also found that the way that foods were classified was real weird. For example, if you searched
      a store for apples, it would first give you all of the different kinds of apple baby food that the store held. At that
      point in the project, we decided to just move forward with the API that we had, even though it had some data quality issues.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the end, we ended up with this great product that can very reliably tell you the fastest ways to get to stores in your
      area to get baby food, but only if you live in a major metropolitan area. :)</p>

    <h2>Attribution</h2>

    <p>We used three APIs to create our app:
      <ol>
        <li>Supermarket API for product information at local stores</li>
        <li>Yummly API for the recipe database</li>
        <li>Google Maps for geocoding, driving directions, and live map</li>
      </ol>
