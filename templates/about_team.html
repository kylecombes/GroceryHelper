    <h2>Why Groceries?</h2>

    <p>When brainstorming ideas for this project we all identified the challenge of
      acquiring all of the ingredients we needed to prepare meals a real struggle.
      As busy college students we wanted a way to quickly determine the best plan to
      complete all of our grocery shopping and from that idea GroceryHelper was born.
    </p>

    <h2> Main Idea</h2>
    <p>GroceryHelper is a tool to make grocery shopping quicker and easier. When ingredients
      and an origin location are inputted, our GroceryHelper webapp will output a shopping plan
      which includes: a list of stores to visit in sequential order, a map with directions to
      each store and back to your origin, and a list of which ingredients to buy at each store.
      The outputted path is the minimum distance the user has to travel in order to get all the
      ingredients they need. The goal of GroceryHelper is to minimize time spent shopping and the
      disappointment of caused by not finding the items that the shopper wants at the grocery store.
      Additionally, If the shopper does not know what they want to eat they can input a cuisine and
      some ingredients and GroceryHelper will output a recipe and a path plan to purchase the extra
      ingredients needed.</p>


    <h2>Implementation information</h2>

    <p>The GroceryHelper path finding algorithm works by first filtering grocery stores by Euclidean
      distance using lat/long from converting the users origin address. It then sorts the stores by
      nearest to farthest Euclidian distance and tries every path, skipping stores that do not provide
       any new needed items. Each calculated path is then scored based on percentage of items still needed
       at that store and distance from last stop.</p>

    <p>We used three APIâ€™s to create our app:
      <ol id = 'red'>
        <li>Supermarket API for product information at local stores</li>
        <li>Yummly API for the recipe database</li>
        <li>Google Maps for geocoding, driving directions, and live map</li>
      </ol>
